ran into problems with Remix, it seems one of the dependencies had an update that broke... everything? Even the tutorial code isn't working today. Gonna take this as a cue to put some effort into learning Vue & Vue Router. Probably a whole new codebase coming in the next couple days, I'm liking the speed and accessbility of developing in Vue.
